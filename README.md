# Keras Triplet Loss Implementation

This project implements the triplet loss as described in "Deep Learning using Triplet Network" by Hoffer and Ailon.

### Deprecation notice
Nowadays, tensorflow makes this available through `tf.contrib.losses.metric_learning.triplet_semihard_loss`, so I can no longer recommend people use this code.
